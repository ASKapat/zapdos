Joule heating is working. It simply appears that currently the energy losses due to ionzation and elastic collisions outweigh the energy gains due to Joule heating.

Going to really start investigating what prevents taking long time steps. With no off diag jacobian elements for electrons and ions and off diag element for potential turned off, and with the following variable scalings:

em: 1e-11
Arp: 1e-6
potential: 1e4

the step size at 1e-7 seconds is 1.6e-9

em: 1e-6
Arp: 1e-6
potential: 1e4

the step size at 1e-7 seconds is 1.6e-9

Currently not able to even get to 1e-7 seconds with NEWTON. Perhaps my Jacobian is wrong. But it could also be right.

Best sim fail: somewhere in the microsecond range.

These simulation failures are fundamentally different from the problems I was having before. Before the solutions were all smooth and pretty but the solves were either diverging or just going too slowly. I believe that this was simply because my relative tolerance was too high. If making the tolerance higher doesn't introduce oscillations in the solution and it allows the time steps to be much longer, than I am absolutely going to increase the tolerance! My priority is getting a solution. I don't care if there's too much diffusion for example. I don't give a damn about that. 

However, now I'm seeing oscillations. Fundamentally different problem. A better problem in my opinion. 

Three individual things I'm going to try (only change one variable at a time! Be patient!!!)

1) Scale up the potential residual. Fail time: 5.50e-7 seconds
   Worse!
2) Increase the mesh density (Increased from 4000 to 8000 elements). Petsc failed with message: "Computed Nan differencing parameter h." Fail tiem again at 1.27e-8 seconds. So all the dependent variable solutions look beautifully smooth. However, there is an oscillation in the electron temperature at the cathode. This could be relevant because the electron temperature is in the source term for the electrons and ions. There are two things that should be done here. 1) I am going to try doubling the mesh resolution again. 2) It's worth looking into whether there are suggestions in combating the "Nan differencing parameter" for Petsc. Perhaps the recent messages on the Moose message board about Petsc error on fine mesh?
3) Decrease the relative tolerance. (Decreased from 1e-2 to 1e-3). Petsc failed with message: "Computed Nan differencing parameter h." Fail time: 1.27e-8 seconds. I didn't check how the solutions looked when the problem failed. If there were no oscillations in the solution, then the problem wasn't with the solution.
Way worse!
